I'm a Frontend Software Engineer with a strong background in Reactjs, Nextjs, Redux, and Typescript. Also, I love designing and coordinating user experience subjects. I consider myself an active self-starter with deep soft skills for engaging resources and getting deep buy-in on my project. My pride is in every line of code that I write for the sole benefit of the person who uses that product. I hope that the work that I do allows me to build on my own experiences. 
I've experienced the front-end frameworks or libraries such as Tailwind, Material UI, and Unit Testing with Jest and I'm very comfortable with Restful APIs, Docker, Git, Eslint, Prettier, Husky, and Jira. Finally, my teamwork is known as a hardworking person who has high coding speed.

Skills: REACT / JS / TS / HTML / CSS
